# Backend Project - Work with static files

The highlights of this project are:

- **Express Server:** Created a server using `Express JS` and by making use of the HTTP Requessts we are rendering the static files that are stored inside the public folder. Express comes handy when using middlewares, and we have used one of the middlewares to serve the static files.

- **CSS:** CSS is implemented to give some flavor to the webpages. Background images are added along with `animation on hover` on the **title** of the website and `transition` on anchor tags.
